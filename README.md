`graphql-up` is the fastest way to get a free & ready to use GraphQL API. It works out of the box with Apollo & Relay and supports GraphQL subscriptions.

Here is a quick demo ([see this video tutorial for more details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWS7SGcp7cY)):

## Features

* üöÄ Get a instant **GraphQL API for your schema**
* ‚öõÔ∏è Optimized endpoints for Apollo & Relay
* üë®‚Äçüè´ Easy to add to your own tutorials, docs & examples


## Quickstart

```graphql
type Tweet {
  id: ID!
  text: String!
  author: User! @relation(name: "Tweets")
}

type User {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
  tweets: [Tweet!]! @relation(name: "Tweets")
}
```

Copy the schema above and save it as `twitter.schema`.

```sh
# Install the CLI via npm (or yarn)
npm install -g graphql-up

# Create GraphQL API using your local schema file
graphql-up twitter.schema
```
